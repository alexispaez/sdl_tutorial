# The Lazy Foo' SDL2 tutorials implemented in Ada using sdlada
I'm writing these tutorials as an exercise to learn Ada, how to create Ada bindings to external libraries and to learn SDL itself.

The original Lazy Foo' tutorials can be found here: https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php.

The sdlada bindings can be found here: https://github.com/ada-game-framework/sdlada.

All the different tutorials are written as Alire crates and can be built and executed using Alire. Alire can be found at: https://alire.ada.dev/

This is still work in progress, but I hope you enjoy them!
